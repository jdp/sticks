Sticks Microframework

ABOUT

Sticks is a small PHP framework that allows a web developer to separate
application logic from presentation. It doesn't enforce any kind of
design pattern, aside from keeping the base names (filenames without the
extension) of templates and scripts the same.

THE FUTURE

Sticks has stagnated, and been superseded by my Tessera framework. The
new framework still holds to many of Sticks' ideals, but is implemented
in a more clean, simple, and modern way. The project is available at:
